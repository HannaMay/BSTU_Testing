Now l know Some may go
Show me the things I seen in you before I hope you will
Tell me all the dreams we tranced some time before you knew a real
Yeah

Something change for good along the way yeah we were
Young and nothing could go wrong
First you loved today from all away
I was caught up in games till I found you
Now I know (I know)
Why my love is
Oh oh so strong (so strong)
Some may go life unnoticed what do you want
Kiss me the way the way it did when we were kids behind the stage yeah yeah
Fly with me with flowing eyes while passing by like it's just a phase
But I couldn't take my eyes off you
Something change for good along the way
We were young and nothing could go wrong
First you loved today from all away my heart away
I was caught up in games till I found you
Now I know
Why my love is so strong (so strong)

Some may go (may go)
Life unnoticed what do you want
